  // Why is this context distinct from the global execution context that Scala provides
  // out of the box?
  // In short, because browsers / JS are _very different_ from the JVM. Copying / pasting
  // from the macrotask executor's explanation of why that library exists in its README:
  // (https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-macrotask-executor/tree/v1.0.0)
  //
  // "Unless you have some very, very specific and unusual requirements, this is the optimal
  // ExecutionContext implementation for use in any Scala.js project.
  // If you're using ExecutionContext and not using this project, you likely have some serious
  // bugs and/or performance issues waiting to be discovered."
  //
  // This library goes through the trouble of providing this special execution context and
  // reorganizing just to provide that context in tests to make it more obvious for downstream
  // JS consumers what to fix / how to make a pretty menacing warning go away.
